    "summary": "Create a Viewer with a WebGLRenderer, a Scene and one View. In the Scene, build a SceneModel containing a table-shaped model. Configure the SceneModel with retained: false, which causes it to not retain SceneObject, SceneMesh and SceneGeometry components in memory, resulting in a smaller memory footprint. The Viewer then draws the model in the View's canvas.",
