// Browser-Friendly Loaders

// Libs like "@xeokit/gltf" and "@xeokit/las" have dependencies (polyfills) that only work on
// node.js, so they can't be built into a Browser-loadable library. That doesn't matter,
// because "@xeokit/xgf" can, and serves as xeokit's Browser-friendly model format, where
// the other formats are intended for offline conversion to XGF anyway.
